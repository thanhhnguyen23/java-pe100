---
# 6 simple rules all participants must follow.
---

## Tweet out a photo of yourself giving a thumbs-up and announcing that you are committing to the #ProjectEuler100 challenge.
## Create a GitHub repository.
## Each time you complete a challenge, add your solution to your GitHub repository and tweet a link to it using the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag.
## Then scroll through the #ProjectEuler100 hashtag and give supportive feedback on at least 2 tweets from other developers.
## Move on to the next Project Euler challenge. You can't skip ahead. You have to complete all 100 problems in order. But you can use any programming language you want to solve these.
## Once you've finished all 100 of them, tweet out a celebration photo of yourself with your laptop open to your GitHub repo.
